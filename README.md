- 👋 Hi, I’m @flawlessfundamentals an idea that started from observing the challenges IT professionals manage when supporting customers through my time on the front lines as a service desk analyst to today.  Time flies when you are fortunate to do what you are passionate about and why I smile with pride knowing that I have over 20 years of experience within end user services.  

Leveraging the Help Desk Institute as well as ITIL definitely helped everyone understand end user services terminology and would become the foundation to address most of the challenges.  But, like some of you know, there was still work to be done. 

This is where the level of innovation, collaboration, commitment towards addressing all the challenges resulted in knowledge management practices designed with the US Education Standards.  Triaging quality controls/processes from ISO Standards.  XLA practices simplifying Change and Problem Management.  Refined metrics resulting in meaningful data.  

Embodying the Flawless Fundamental Service Champion, we hold delivering exceptional value to customers the definition of our success. This approach transcends mere "good" service towards aiming to craft an extraordinary customer experience that not only meets their needs but surpasses their expectations.  
This is also why we appreciate there are only a few/proud Flawless Fundamental Service Champions.  But when you meet one, you know it!
 

- 👀 I’m interested in developing more service champions and a shout out to those out there!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all I can about XLA's (Experience Level Agreements).  The more I learn, the more I incorporate them with traditional SLA's to refine our metrics and what we define as a successful support interaction.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on refining ITSM Dashboards
